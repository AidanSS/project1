title: About Us
description: In this project our team was able to apply our HTML skills by developing a static site generated by <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>.<br>Our site showcases a collection of photos that have been extraced from a .json file provided by <a href="https://www.pexels.com/">Pexels</a>.<br>Each photo has its own page that contains a larger, captioned version of the photo along with more information about the photographer including their Pexels page and ID.
